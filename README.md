The ready-made garment (RMG) industry faces significant challenges like quickly changing fashion trends, tough competition, and complex supply chains. To maintain its pace and remain profitable, the manufacturers need to make their production line management as efficient as possible. Line balancing is an important aspect of production line management, where the right number of workers are placed at each step of the production process to prevent delays and keep things running smoothly. This allows companies to produce quality garments at a faster rate and at a lower cost.
This project uses AnyLogic simulation software, which can help in testing various setups in the garment industry. With AnyLogic, manufacturers can safely experiment with different production scenarios in a virtual environment and find the best ways to organize their lines. This helps to solve problems before they occur and optimize the manufacturing process.
